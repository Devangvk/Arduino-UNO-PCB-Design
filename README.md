# Arduino-UNO-PCB-Design
This repository contains full PCB design of Arduino UNO. This design was done completely from scrath, starting with selecting components from digikey, creating schematic symbols, creating footprints, placing components, routing and improving the layout.                                                                                       
The schematic was referred from https://content.arduino.cc/assets/UNO-TH_Rev3e_sch.pdf
